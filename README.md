Stitches Unlimited

Stitches Unlimited is a company from Humboldt that embroiders logos onto products in order to promote one's business. The main idea behind this website is to offer a clear, user friendly UI that can be accessible to all ages. We understand that websites play an enormous role in promoting small, local businesses, so we made sure to construct the most concise website we can.

This site was created by Matthew Thornton, Colin Richardson, and Tanner Snell.

Our website consists of many things, but the most notable of which include:

- Full responsiveness across all devices.

- Fully functioning order system in which one can find a product, read about the product, add the product to cart, and order the product.

- Unique and creative catalogue structure.

- A clean and easy-on-the-eyes color palette and font.

- In depth details about all the products.

- An organized column arrangement allowing one to be able to comprehend information easily.

- Manually edited images including:

  - Catalogue items with a transparent background.

  - A light red and dark red cart when you hover over it.

  - Updated logo for better display colors.

  - Red background for the "Item of the Day" in order to work with the red border around it.

  - Trending items made wider to fit in the carousel.

- Efficient system for the product pages of all the catalogue items.

- Embedded Google Maps into contact page for the location of Stitches Unlimited.

- Awards and accolades Stitches Unlimited have received to build credibility in the company (ethos).

Thank you for considering our website. This project involved an enormous ensemble of commitment and work, but ultimately, it was an incredible experience full of ups, downs, and - most importantly - perseverance.
